In this course, instructor Nikiya Simpson guides you through four main types of SQL joins, with plenty of opportunities to try what you’re learning. Nikiya starts with schema description SQL commands, plus table and column description SQL commands. She goes over inner joins, then dives into left joins, self joins, and multiple complex joins. Nikiya also covers right joins, full outer joins, and cross joins.<br><br>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup.
